<h1>HTML</h1>

<p>HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee. HTML is widely popular today as almost all websites use HTML as a way to relate and connect 
different types of information. HTML can be used to display basic text, images, videos, etc. HTML links are commonly seen online as
the blue underlined words or phrases that can be clicked on in order to reach a specific destination.</p>

<!-- HTML also uses comments like this in order for the user to communicate a message to anyone viewing the source code. 
Comments are not seen in the actual HTML page.-->
